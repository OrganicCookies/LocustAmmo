{"code": 1, "name": "�˹�����1-�Ҹ�˹", "list": ["It starts with success.", "And success, is all about growing.", "Success is all about overcoming your demons, success is about getting knocked down, time after time, and getting back up. No one embodies that more than Martin Larsson.", "Rekkles. He is one of the most experienced and celebrated marksmen in Europe and the World, but regardless of that resum��, he has never won an international trophy, but he has never lost his drive.", "And what's more is that even a couple of years ago, even making a Championship Final seemed out of reach.", "Until 2018, everything was set up to perfection for Martin and for Fnatic. They reconquered Europe after years of G2 domination, Caps stepped up as a true carry, and they faced an IG in the Finals they had beaten twice in the group stage. But as we all know, it was a tragedy, it was a quick exit. It was a shameful display, and what was worse, it felt like a lost opportunity that may never come again, for Rekkles, for Fnatic and for Europe.", "the LPL rose as the unbeateable beast we know them to be. And the LPL would dominate the World Championship two times in a row. But Rekkles, he did not stop fighting, and in fact in 2019, he was finally able to put one of his biggest demons to bed, with Uzi and RNG.", "And now? Now we're here. 2020. Where the expectations for Fnatic were at their lowest ahead of this best of five versus Top Esports, the first seed from the LPL. The LPL that has beaten EU down in these best of fives, time and time again; and JackeyLove, standing tall and poised to win his second World Championship.", "But so far we haven't gotten LPL domination, we haven't gotten the JackeyLove highlight reels, and we've gotten Rekkles and Hylissang lane kingdom.", "It all comes down to this next game. Demons can be slayed, expectations be damned, and Rekkles can cement himself as the player he always wanted to prove he was.", "In this next game. It's all up to him and Fnatic to make their dreams come true.", "'JackeyLove oversteps again!' is pretty much this worlds themesong.", "Poor Karsa trying to drag JKL��s inting body to a win almost every game.", "I fucking love Suning's story this worlds. They beat out G2 in groups, then went through BOTH of their 'betters' in the LPL and beat them both in 3-1's, after TES 3-0'd Suning just in playoffs.", "If they beat out Damwon it's absolutely fucking clear that they were the best team by far at the tournament, because they went through literally all of the best that this Worlds had to offer. And they came in as the No3 seed from the LPL. Insane.", "Incredible series from Suning. Sofm with the clutch steals in Game 1, Bin with the unkillable Jax in Game 3, Angel with the legendary performance on Akali in Game 4. Everyone on Suning stepped the fuck up when it mattered most.", "Phreak screaming I've seen this play before literally bring flashback to viewers in their head. NA casters is definitely better than EU casters for semifinals.", "Beating both China number 1 and number 2 teams as the 3rd seed from the same region and making worlds finals.", "What a story for Sunning. I really hope they can win it all (tho I expect Damwon too be favoured).", "From harassing Ashe and stopping her recall in front of the base turrets [Yes, Leona did spend ult for that] to Bin getting an adrenaline rush and wanting to go for solo baron", "Dragon soul curse is here.. Akali is dancing all around the place, SofM is going 1vAll the whole time and does the 'standing there, menacingly'", "Really the worst time for JKL to have some of this worst games in this career these past 2 series.", "Also Angel's Akali is actually nuts, he completely popped off vs Knights Ori and Caps Syndra so far this worlds on it.", "Suning is SO fun to watch, I can't wait to watch these finals. Sofm plays just on the edge of disrespect and I love it. Angel playing out of his mind.", "If Bin is ever put on a tank in the finals, I propose Suning's coach gets a heavy fine.", "Angel honestly has been just ramping up ever since his first game in groups where he looked shaky and got picked on a bit to now being such a huge carry in the last game to take out TES in this series.", "Angel hard gapped Knight that final game and put JackeyLove in the dirt every single time, he was so clean. And Bin splitpushing with such confidence is amazing to watch.", "Now Suning just need to close it out. We can finally get a victory for the Flash Wolves.", "Speaking of which, the Karsa and SwordArt hug after the match honestly made me cry.", "People (over)rate Jackeylove, TheShy, Caps, like gods daily, but forget how insanely inconsistent they are.", "SofM is a fucking jungling psychopath.", "Feel for Alphari, goes to TL wanting to play with DL. Gets shafted by Visas then joins a TL that is imploding. Jatt becomes a coach and DL leaves and then he's just let go after getting 1 proper split with the team and coach. Not a fun situation for him after they had a respectable worlds showing", "Respectable Worlds showing because they had good lv1's that made the team look entirely different. But when they didn't have a Lv1 like that the team afked and bled out like always.", "Because Alphari's an import and TL is not going to part with CoreJJ, Broxah's (probably) not going to be on TL for 2020", "I don't think anyone is even remotely surprised with that. Broxah has a large defense squad on reddit because they love his personality, but the guy was a straight liability this year.", "Biggest difference is how Broxah plays after a good Lv1 and when it's just a regular game without a Lv1 play. They get a good Lv1 against G2 and Broxah is literally bullying Jankos in his own jungle, made the team as a whole perform way better.", "It shows how important it is for your jungler to do shit. Then when that's not the case, Broxah just sits and farms and so the laners do the same while the other team makes plays.", "I keep reading this sentiment but it��s a two-way street. TL��s laners played incredibly passive this year and it is so hard to do anything as the jungler if your laners aren��t willing to do more than play passive and bleed out.", "I��m not saying that he is blameless but he isn��t the only factor for TL��s incredibly passive playstyle.", "Not a broxa fan boy and nor am I defending him. If the team wants to play a certain way, he should be able to adapt. And he didn��t adapt the greatest to TL��s comfort style.", "But if the team is playing a certain ��do nothing�� style, you can��t expect the jungler to be playing aggressively and ��doing shit�� if the team isn��t also playing around that aggressive jungle style and able to back them up. All of those pieces have to be on the same page for it to work and make sense.You want to see players like Broxah succeed, but ultimately it's a competition. A personality can enhance skill (Bjergsen, Perkz) or detract from it (Forg1ven, Dardoch) but ultimately it's about the skill itself. Broxah is either in a hard slump or just doesn't have the skill to be on a top team anymore."]}
